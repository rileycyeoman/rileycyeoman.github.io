### Valve Sizing Tool

---
Tool for choosing piping and valve sizing based on fluid GPM. This is intended to be used by sales as a means of providing AD-approved valve sizing.  
<div class = "code-example" markdown = "1">
<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/images/valve.png"

</div>
The only allowable input is fluid GPM. Pipe size is outputted in the line box and the text browser displays the corresponding Griswold valve based on a search table.


{: .warning }
>Check with the AD team when using GPMs outside of normal ranges, particularily with valve sizes above 10".


{: .note }
>Valve ranges are in the range of 0.5" to 10". Roughly this translate to 7.6-1600 GPM. 

#### Formulas

$$\text{Inner Diameter} = \sqrt{\frac{Q * 144}{v * \frac{\pi}{4} * 448.86}}$$

#### Code
--- 
Piping sizes are pulled based on the following table:
